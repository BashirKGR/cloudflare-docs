description: Get an overview of how Cloudflare is implementing post-quantum cryptography to protect you against store now, decrypt later.
---

For years, Cloudflare has been researching and [writing about post quantum](https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/post-quantum/).

To protect you against the risk of [store now, decrypt later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later), and considering all the [connections](#three-connections-in-the-life-of-a-request) that take place when your website or application is on Cloudflare, we have deployed and are actively expanding the use of post-quantum hybrid key agreement.

:::caution[TLS 1.3]
Post-quantum key agreements are only supported in protocols based on TLS 1.3 (including HTTP/3) and are disabled for websites in [FIPS mode](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/#fips-compliance).

## Three building blocks of TLS

Before TLS can protect your communications, three cryptographic algorithms have to be agreed on during the [TLS handshake](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/):

- **Symmetric ciphers:** algorithms used to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring confidentiality and integrity (such as `CHACHA20-POLY1305`).
- **Key agreement:** a cryptographic protocol that allows client and server to safely agree on a shared key (such as `ECDH`).
- **Signature algorithms:** cryptographic algorithms used to generate the digital signatures in TLS certificates (such as `RSA` and `ECDSA`).

As explained in our [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/#two-migrations), the first, most urgent migration that needs to happen has to do with key agreement.

### Visitor to Cloudflare

As of [october 2023](https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all/), all websites and APIs served through Cloudflare support post-quantum hybrid key agreement.
